# Building ZeroPool: How I Made LLM Checkpoint Loading 3.8x Faster

The story of engineering a high-performance buffer pool in Rust after hitting unexpected bottlenecks with existing solutions.

## The Problem Was Hiding in Plain Sight

I was building an io_uring-based LLM checkpoint loader for loading safetensors model files. The goal seemed straightforward: read model weights as fast as possible using Linux's newest async I/O interface. io_uring promised zero-copy, kernel-level efficiency, the architecture looked perfect on paper.

The initial approach was simple: allocate a buffer large enough for the entire safetensors file, then read it all at once.

```rust
// My initial approach: single large read
async fn load_checkpoint(path: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    let file = File::open(path).await?;
    let metadata = file.metadata().await?;

    // Allocate buffer for the entire file
    let buffer = vec![0u8; metadata.len() as usize];

    // Read all at once
    let (result, buffer) = file.read_at(buffer, 0).await;
    Ok(buffer)
}

```

But when I profiled my code, something was deeply wrong. Loading a GPT-2 checkpoint (around 350MB in safetensors format) took 200ms. The profiler revealed a shocking truth: **70% of that time was spent allocating that single massive buffer, not doing I/O**. The io_uring ring was idle. The disk was barely being used. My program was trapped in `malloc()` and `memset()`.

This is the moment every systems programmer dreads: your bottleneck isn't where you thought it was.

## The Search for an Off-the-Shelf Solution

The fix seemed obvious, stop allocating new buffers every time. Reuse them. This is Computer Science 101, and surely the Rust ecosystem had already solved it?

I explored three popular libraries, each with their own fatal flaws.

**Mempool**: This library returns an immutable reference, but tokio-uring needs owned `Vec<u8>` that can cross await boundaries and be passed to the kernel. You cannot move an owned value out of a reference. Dead end.

**Lifeguard**: Better! It provides a smart pointer wrapper. But it doesn't implement Send or Sync, which means you cannot wrap it in `Arc` to share across async tasks. For a multi-threaded workload, this library was off the table.

**Object-Pool**: Thread-safe, shareable, but the implementation didn't deliver the throughput I needed for high-volume I/O workloads. Measurement showed it wasn't meeting performance targets.

Each library solved 80% of the problem. None of them solved _my_ 20%.

## Building Exactly What I Needed

At this point I had a choice: accept the limitations of existing solutions, or engineer the exact thing my workload required.

I chose to build. Here's what I needed:

- Owned `Vec<u8>` buffers, not references, not smart pointers
- Thread-safe sharing across async tasks
- Optimized for high-throughput I/O patterns
- Dead simple API: just `get()` and `put()`

![TLS Cache Architecture](/blog_materials/zeropool/tls-architecture.png)

The architecture hinges on one key insight: **most buffer requests can be satisfied from thread-local storage with zero contention and zero locks**. When thread-local storage runs out, fall back to a sharded global pool.

This two-tier design resembles familiar memory management patterns, L1 cache hitting a majority of the time, with L2 handling misses. In practice, thread-local TLS satisfies majority of requests without ever acquiring a lock.

### Why Sharding Prevents Bottlenecks

A single global `Mutex<Vec<Vec<u8>>>` would be a catastrophe. With eight threads hammering it, you'd spend more time waiting for locks than doing work.

Sharding solves this by distributing contention across multiple locks. Threads round-robin through shards, which means each shard is acquired less frequently. Power-of-2 sharding enables a particularly elegant optimization:

```rust
// Fast shard selection using bitwise AND (no division!)
let shard_idx = thread_counter & (num_shards - 1);
let shard = unsafe { shards.get_unchecked(shard_idx) }.lock();

```

Bitwise AND is single-cycle. Modulo division is not. This matters when you're in a hot loop millions of times per second.

## The Unsafe Optimization You're Probably Not Doing

When you write `vec![0u8; 1024 * 1024]`, Rust allocates 1MB and writes zeros to every single byte. That's an entire megabyte traversing the memory bus. And here's the kicker: **I'm about to overwrite it with file data anyway**. Those zeros are discarded immediately.

This is where unsafe code becomes a tool rather than a curse:

```rust
let mut buffer = Vec::with_capacity(size);
unsafe { buffer.set_len(size); }
// Buffer contains uninitialized data, but I'm reading into it immediately
file.read_at(buffer, offset).await;

```

**Is this safe?** Yes, with documented invariants:

1.  The buffer has sufficient capacity (verified before the unsafe block)
2.  I never read from the buffer before writing to it
3.  io_uring immediately overwrites the entire buffer
4.  If you did read before writing, you'd see garbage, not undefined behavior, just garbage

This optimization alone accounts for roughly 40% of the performance improvement over naive allocation. It's not magic; it's just eliminating redundant work.

## The Results

With ZeroPool integrated into my checkpoint loader:

**200ms → 53ms. A 3.8x speedup.**

The allocator was the bottleneck all along. io_uring was ready to move at wire speed. I just needed to get out of its way.

### Benchmark Data

Single-threaded allocation and deallocation:

| Buffer Size | ZeroPool | No Pool | Lifeguard | Bytes Crate |
|-------------|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1KB         | 8.4ns    | 7.2ns   | 7.0ns     | 7.5ns       |
| 64KB        | 8.4ns    | 43.6ns  | 6.5ns     | 43.5ns      |
| 1MB         | 8.3ns    | 35.3ns  | 6.5ns     | 44.5ns      |

ZeroPool maintains constant 8ns latency regardless of buffer size—5x faster than the bytes crate for large buffers.

Multi-threaded throughput tells the real story:

| Thread Count | ZeroPool   | No Pool   | Sharded-Slab |
|--------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2            | 10.3 TiB/s | 2.8 TiB/s | 1.4 TiB/s    |
| 4            | 18.7 TiB/s | 5.4 TiB/s | 2.7 TiB/s    |
| 8            | 28.1 TiB/s | 9.3 TiB/s | 4.8 TiB/s    |

Near-linear scaling with thread count, and 3x faster than sharded-slab under contention. The two-tier design, TLS plus sharded global, eliminates the lock-free data structure complexity while delivering the performance.

## Design Decisions That Stuck

**Thread-Local Cache Size**: Too small means frequent shared pool access. Too large means wasteful memory per thread. I use system-aware defaults: 2 buffers for embedded systems, 4 for desktops, 6 for workstations, and 8 for servers.

**Power-of-2 Shards**: This enables bitwise AND instead of modulo division, faster by orders of magnitude. Plus, you can use `get_unchecked()` because the mask mathematically guarantees bounds.

**LIFO Cache Order**: Most recently used buffers are cache-hot in CPU L3. Accessing them first improves cache utilization. This is a small detail that compounds across millions of requests.

**First-Fit Over Best-Fit**: Best-fit scans the pool to find the smallest suitable buffer. For I/O workloads with predictable buffer sizes, first-fit is `O(1)` in practice. Simpler and faster.

## The API: Designed for Simplicity

```rust
use zeropool::BufferPool;

let pool = BufferPool::new(); // System-aware defaults

// Get a buffer
let buffer = pool.get(1024 * 1024);

// Use it for I/O
file.read_at(buffer, offset).await;

// Return it
pool.put(buffer);

```

No lifetimes, no generics, no configuration complexity unless you want it.

### Advanced: Memory Pinning for Latency-Critical Workloads

For ultra-low-latency systems, pin buffers in RAM to prevent OS swapping:

```rust
let pool = BufferPool::builder()
    .pinned_memory(true) // Uses `mlock()`
    .build();

```

This prevents buffer memory from being swapped to disk, ensuring consistent latency. Useful for high-frequency trading systems, real-time audio/video processing, and security-sensitive workloads where swap leakage is a concern.

## What This Experience Taught Me

**Profile first, optimize second**: I assumed io_uring was the bottleneck. Profiling showed the allocator was. Measurement beats intuition every single time.

**Existing libraries aren't always the answer**: Sometimes the 80% solution doesn't cover your 20%. Building from scratch isn't failure; it's pragmatism when the problem space is well-defined and your requirements are clear.

**Unsafe code is a tool with documentation requirements**: Rust's safety guarantees are remarkable, but sometimes you step outside them. The key is rigorously documenting your safety invariants so future maintainers (or you, six months from now) understand exactly why the unsafe code is sound.

**Thread-local storage is underrated**: Lock-free data structures are genuinely hard to build correctly. Thread-local storage gives you lock-free behavior for free within a single thread. Use it aggressively.

**Power-of-2 everything**: If your size or count can be a power of 2, make it one. You unlock bitwise operations, cache alignment, and compiler optimizations that simply aren't available otherwise.

## Try It Yourself

ZeroPool is on crates.io:

```bash
cargo add zeropool

```

Source: [github.com/botirk38/zeropool](https://github.com/botirk38/zeropool)

Run the benchmarks yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/botirk38/zeropool
cd zeropool
cargo bench

```

## What's Next

Ideas in exploration:

- Async `get()` API for backpressure control when pool exhaustion occurs
- Size-class buckets to maintain separate pools for different buffer ranges
- NUMA awareness for multi-socket systems
- Custom allocator support (jemalloc, mimalloc)

For now, ZeroPool does exactly one thing: get out of the way and let io_uring fly.
